These general terms and conditions (the \u201C<strong>Terms of Service</strong>\u201D) apply to all our Services and govern the use of Minefort.com. By using Minefort.com you acknowledge and accept applicability of these Terms of Service, including future modifications thereof. </p><p> Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Service. By using or accessing the Service, you agree to all the terms and conditions stated in these Terms of Service and a service agreement between Minefort.com and you as a user comes into force (the \u201C<strong>Agreement</strong>\u201D). If, at any time, you do not or cannot agree to these Terms of Service, you must stop accessing or using the Service. </p><ol class="list-decimal"><li><strong>Conditions relating to use of the Service</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> In order to use our service, you must be at least 13 years of age. If you are 13 or older but under 18 years of age, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use our service. Please have them read through this agreement with you. </li><li> The website and all corresponding services are usually available 24 hours per day. But interruptions of this availability might occur because of planned maintenance or unforeseen events. A faultless operation of the website is technically impossible and therefore we cannot accept the responsibility for errors of any kind. </li><li> We always try to ensure that all your data is saved correctly and available at any time, especially the files of the provided services. But it\u2019s possible that there are failures while transmitting, storing, retrieving, or operating those services, which leads to a partial or full loss of data. We don\u2019t assume any liability related to lost data or resulting damages. The user is responsible for creating backups using the tools provided by us. </li><li> Furthermore, the availability of the website depends on conditions and benefits beyond our influence, e.g. a user\u2019s internet connection. We are not responsible for disturbances caused by those conditions. </li><li> The Service allows each natural person to create and operate one account. Creating and actively operating more than one account is not permitted. Exceeding the account limit will result in account termination at operator&#39;s discretion. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Privacy</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> Access to most functions of the website requires the creation of a user account. For this purpose, a username and an email address must be provided. </li><li> Since the email address is used for the payment process, among other things, it must be valid and functional. This is ensured by a verification email containing a link, that needs to be opened in a web browser. </li><li> You are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of your account credentials, i.e. your password, and for restricting access to your devices. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. </li><li> You are solely responsible for any loss of access, such as loss of password. A recovery of access through the linked email address is generally possible, but not guaranteed. In the event of a complete loss of access, we will not be able to provide a refund or give you access to any account data. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Intellectual Proprietary Rights</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> All right, title, and interest in and to the Service and the website are and shall remain the exclusive property of Minefort.com and third-parties providing facilities and technology for its operation.
