These general terms and conditions (the “<strong>Terms of Service</strong>”) apply to all our Services and govern the use of Minefort.com. By using Minefort.com you acknowledge and accept applicability of these Terms of Service, including future modifications thereof. </p><p> Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Service. By using or accessing the Service, you agree to all the terms and conditions stated in these Terms of Service and a service agreement between Minefort.com and you as a user comes into force (the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”). If, at any time, you do not or cannot agree to these Terms of Service, you must stop accessing or using the Service. </p><ol class="list-decimal"><li><strong>Conditions relating to use of the Service</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> In order to use our service, you must be at least 13 years of age. If you are 13 or older but under 18 years of age, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use our service. Please have them read through this agreement with you. </li><li> The website and all corresponding services are usually available 24 hours per day. But interruptions of this availability might occur because of planned maintenance or unforeseen events. A faultless operation of the website is technically impossible and therefore we cannot accept the responsibility for errors of any kind. </li><li> We always try to ensure that all your data is saved correctly and available at any time, especially the files of the provided services. But it’s possible that there are failures while transmitting, storing, retrieving, or operating those services, which leads to a partial or full loss of data. We don’t assume any liability related to lost data or resulting damages. The user is responsible for creating backups using the tools provided by us. </li><li> Furthermore, the availability of the website depends on conditions and benefits beyond our influence, e.g. a user’s internet connection. We are not responsible for disturbances caused by those conditions. </li><li> The Service allows each natural person to create and operate one account. Creating and actively operating more than one account is not permitted. Exceeding the account limit will result in account termination at operator&#39;s discretion. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Privacy</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> Access to most functions of the website requires the creation of a user account. For this purpose, a username and an email address must be provided. </li><li> Since the email address is used for the payment process, among other things, it must be valid and functional. This is ensured by a verification email containing a link, that needs to be opened in a web browser. </li><li> You are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of your account credentials, i.e. your password, and for restricting access to your devices. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. </li><li> You are solely responsible for any loss of access, such as loss of password. A recovery of access through the linked email address is generally possible, but not guaranteed. In the event of a complete loss of access, we will not be able to provide a refund or give you access to any account data. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Intellectual Proprietary Rights</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> All right, title, and interest in and to the Service and the website are and shall remain the exclusive property of Minefort.com and third-parties providing facilities and technology for its operation. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other domestic and foreign laws concerning intellectual property. Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you may not reproduce, modify, or create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use the Service. </li><li> Users shall indemnify Minefort.com from any claims of third parties regarding or related to intellectual property infringement by such a User. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Third-Party Content</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> Our website offers the ability to install or upload content from third-parties (software, mods, plugins, add-ons, etc.). We can’t guarantee that that content is functional, updated or safe. This is especially true for uploaded content. We also can’t provide any support for third-party content. </li><li> You have to ensure that the third-party content installed or uploaded by you is from trustworthy sources and that you are respecting all rights of any involved party. This explicitly includes the Minecraft / Mojang Studios End User License Agreement: <a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula" target="_blank">https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula</a></li></ol></li><li><strong>Acceptable Use</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> By using the Service, you acknowledge that you must not utilize the website in any way that may cause damage, harm, or any harmful impairment to both the accessibility and availability of Minefort.com nor in any manner which would be considered unlawful, illicit, harmful, or fraudulent. </li><li> By using the Service, you acknowledge that Minefort.com and it’s staff may at any time access and modify your Minecraft server, information and anything pertaining to your on-site account. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Modifications To The Service And Prices</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> Prices for our products are subject to change without notice. </li><li> We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time. </li><li> All subscription invoices are generated 10 days before payment is due along with a 10 day grace period after the due date to request either an extension or make payment on the service. After 4 days of nonpayment from the due date, the service will be suspended with or without any notification. After 10 days of non-payment from the due date, your subscription access will be terminated and Minefort.com will not be held responsible for any data loss due to termination. It is user’s responsibility to keep up with payment and have knowledge of payment due dates. </li><li> Minefort.com reserves the rights to deny or provide refunds for their services with or without reason, regardless of the &quot;Service Payment, Refunds and Cancellation Guidelines&quot; if the user does not follow the Acceptable Use Policy. All Minecraft servers are guaranteed a 5 DAY refund period from invoice payment. All cancellations must be given 5 days before the next billing due date. </li><li> The 5 day money back guarantee (refund) will only apply for New Users/Accounts. Chargebacks will also be counted as a refund. </li><li> Automatic Billing: Credit card payments will have automatic payment processing enabled by default for user convenience. Instructions on how to stop these automatic payments are found on the credit card entry box in clear view before any payment information is entered. Therefore, the Service is not liable for any automatic charges if the user does not read specified instructions on how to stop payments. Refunds for failure to cancel automatic payments can be issued as long as client contacts Minefort.com promptly (within 5 days of payment processing) through the correct support or billing channels after receiving payment confirmation emails, which are issued immediately after payment is automatically processed. </li><li> We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. </li><li> Chargebacks will result in subscription suspension and permanent account termination. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Account Sharing &amp; Server File Backups</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> Minefort.com serves an environment with the sole purpose of providing hosting services and will not be held responsible for client sharing his or her account (with admins/sub-users) or files are stored on said account. In the event where shared accounts with other users (admins/sub-users) become malicious to the user (due to conflicting interest, etc.), the Service can not be held responsible for this action. </li><li> Minefort.com does not create backups of user files. In case of catastrophic server failure, Minefort.com also does not keep older backups. The user is responsible for their own data management and backups. By subscribing to our website you agree to take appropriate backups and agree Minefort.com cannot be held responsible for any data loss. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Minefort.com, its officers, directors, affiliates, employees and agents, from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Service. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitations of Liability</strong><ol class="list-decimal"><li> Use of our services is at your own risk.
